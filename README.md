# Introduction to Computers & Programming - CSE 1310 Projects

## Course Overview
This repository contains my programming assignments for CSE 1310: Introduction to Computers & Programming. The course provides an introduction to the computer, algorithmic processes, and programming using basic control and data structures in a procedural language.

## Projects

### 1. Simple Patterns (`ean0354_HW2.c`)
   - Demonstrates basic C programming by printing simple patterns, such as asterisks, initials, and tree shapes.

### 2. Basic Operations and Functions (`ean0354_HW3.c`)
   - Implements basic arithmetic operations and explores functions like average calculation and time conversion in C.

### 3. Floating-Point and Character Operations (`ean0354_HW4.c`)
   - Features manipulation of floating-point numbers and characters, including creating a power table.

### 4. Multiple Functions and Operations (`ean0354_HW5_6.c`)
   - A compilation of functions covering various aspects like character identification, leap year checking, and creating a power table.

### 5. Array Manipulation and Barcode System (`ean0354_HW7.c`)
   - Focuses on array operations like checking for duplicates and inverting values, and implements a barcode-based pricing system.

### 6. File Operations and Sorting (`ean0354_HW8.c`)
   - Demonstrates file reading and writing in C, as well as sorting strings in a file alphabetically.

### 7. Sudoku Puzzle Validator (`ean0354_Sudoku.c`)
   - A C program that validates Sudoku puzzles, checking rows, columns, and 3x3 squares for correctness.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic control structures and data types in C.
- Implementation of various C standard library functions.
- Working with arrays, strings, and file I/O.
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## Running the Projects
Each project can be compiled and run using a standard C compiler. Input may be required from the user or read from files, depending on the project.
